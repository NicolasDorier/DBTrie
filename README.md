# DBTrie

This project is a complete rewrite of [DBreeze](https://github.com/hhblaze/DBreeze), which is a managed implementation of a key/value store based on [radix tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_tree).

The initial DBreeze project, while working well, is barely maintained and were showing performance issues for my use cases.

## How to use

This is a basic key value store.

### How to insert

```csharp
static async Task Main(string args)
{
	Directory.CreateDirectory("Db");
	await using (var engine = await DBTrieEngine.OpenFromFolder("Db"))
	{
		var tx = await engine.OpenTransaction();
		var table = tx.GetTable("MyTable");
		await table.Insert("MyKey", "MyValue");
		await tx.Commit();
	}
}
```

### How to delete

```csharp
static async Task Main(string args)
{
	Directory.CreateDirectory("Db");
	await using (var engine = await DBTrieEngine.OpenFromFolder("Db"))
	{
		// ....
		tx.Delete("MyKey");
		tx.Commit();
		// ...
	}
}
```

### How to enumerate

```csharp
static async Task Main(string args)
{
	Directory.CreateDirectory("Db");
	await using (var engine = await DBTrieEngine.OpenFromFolder("Db"))
	{
		// ...
		var table = tx.GetTable("MyTable");
		await foreach (var item in table.Enumerate(startsWith: "Ke"))
		{
			using (item)
			{
				// Do things...
			}
		}
	}
	// ....
}
```

### How to get an item

```csharp
static async Task Main(string args)
{
	Directory.CreateDirectory("Db");
	await using (var engine = await DBTrieEngine.OpenFromFolder("Db"))
	{
		// ....
		using (var row = await tx.Get("MyKey"))
		{
			// Do things...
		}
		// ...
	}
}
```

## Best practices

* The API allows the use of `[ReadOnly]Memory<byte>` extensively to limit allocations. If you are writting performance sensitive code, consider using those.
* Think of disposing the `IRow` you get from a table. This decrease the pressure on the garbage collector.
* Think of disposing the `Transaction` you get from the engine.
* Do not create many tables, each table is backed by a file on disk.

## Todo

* Currently, only a single transaction can be processed at same time. It should be possible to allow concurrent transactions if those do not use the same tables.
* Deleting data does not free up storage space. For freeing storage space, we should try to compact the database when opening the engine.
* We cache the underlying file of each table in-memory. We should evict the least used pages to save memory.
